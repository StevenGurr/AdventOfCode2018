# Advent of Code 2018

Having a crack at [Advent of Code for 2018](https://adventofcode.com).

No promises these are the best solutions ever, but being attempted around a full time and general life goings on...

Doing it in Swift as it's the language I know best and do the most, not necessarily because it's the best tool for the job here.

## Spoiler alert
The `main.swift` file contains all the answers as I go, so don't look in here if you don't want the answer given to you. I put them here so I can re-run all the tests whenever I want and make sure I've not broken anything in any refactor. (Should probably really be in a unit test.)
